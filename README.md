# Recipe Book Site

This is a simple frontend project to display a collection of recipes.

## Description

The project dynamically loads recipes from a JavaScript file (`recipes.js`) and displays them as cards on a webpage. It's built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Getting Started

To view the site, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. There is no build process or server required.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file.
- `style.css`: Contains all the styles for the project.
- `recipes.js`: A JavaScript file containing an array of recipe objects.
- `potential_recipes.js`: A JavaScript file for storing recipe ideas that are not yet displayed.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that reads the recipes and dynamically creates the recipe cards.

## Contributing

Feel free to fork the project and add your own recipes!
